Free Download Premium Version of **PinkTong Blogger Template**. You can change the footer credit easily and used it for unlimited domains of the website. PingTong blogger theme in terms of layout like most templates consists of two columns, namely the posting column and the sidebar column on the left. The default color scheme is purple. In the left bar, the post is in the form of a grid on the index page.

## About PingTong Blogger Template

Considering the use of smartphones in exploring the internet world rose very significantly, I made this template as friendly as possible for smartphone devices both in terms of appearance and function.

As for the features themselves, you can say that they are minimal, which I included only the important ones such as sharing buttons and related posts, and did not include font icons like fontawesome but instead replaced them with svg, knowing I was speed-oriented.
